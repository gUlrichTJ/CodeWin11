We want to, when the user enters in the app, he can see the folders
and enter in the folder he wants.

We can do another thing. If the user enters in the app, he will see
the pdfs that are in his mobile phone. The will be disposed as the
recent folder of google docs.

********Question******
How can we have access to the files that are in the mobile phone ?
How can we dispose them according to something like their size
or the last pdf opened ?
How can we do that when the user clicks the pdf, it opens and
allows him to scroll and read it ?
We will do so that the app reads it for him.
Also,
How can we stay without sinning ? I mean walking in holiness like
Jesus-Christ. No doing something that displease God.
